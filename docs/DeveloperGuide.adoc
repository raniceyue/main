== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[align="center"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.


`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/location/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/location/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

* <<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file, `volant.log`.

The rest of the App consists of four main components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor depending on the view the user is on.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory depending in the view the user is on.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name} Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its
API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== Views in Volant

There are 4 types of pages/views in this App: `HOME`, `TRIP`, `ITINERARY`, `JOURNAL`.
Each view has their own `{Component Name} Manager` classes for both `Logic` and `Model`.

These individual `{Component Name} Manager` classes for `Logic` and `Model` provide a context for commands to be executed in,
e.g. when the user is on the `HOME` page, the `add` command modifies the trip list, when the user
is on the `ITINERARY` page, the `add` command modifies the itinerary.

For example, the `JOURNAL` view has its own `JournalLogicManager` and `JournalModelManager` to provide the context
for command execution on the `JOURNAL` page.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `back` when in a `TRIP` view. View switching is executed by the `Ui` component.

[[view-switch-sequence]]

The _Sequence Diagram_ below illustrates how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user
issues the command `goto 1` when in a `HOME` page view.
View switching is executed by the `Ui` component.

image::gotoCommandSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]

The sections below give more details about each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component when a user is on a `TRIP` page
image::UIClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/location/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter`, `mainPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/location/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

==== View Switching
As there are four different views in Volant. Upon startup of the App, the `mainPanel` is set to `HomePage`.
There are certain commands will cause the `MainWindow` display to switch views.
For example, `goto`, `back` and `home` navigation commands.

When a view is switched, `MainWindow` will do the following:

====
For example, if a user is switching from a `TRIP` view to the `HOME` view through the command, `back`.

. Reassign the `Logic` component from `TripPageLogicManager` to a new `HomePageLogicManager`.
. Reassign the `Model` component from `TripPageModelManager` to a new `HomePageModelManager`.
. Reassign the value of `StackPane` `mainPanel` from `TripPage` to `HomePage`.

<<view-switch-sequence, You can view the sequence diagram for this process here.>>

_More details on the implementation of view switching can be found in <<implementation-view-switching>>._

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram1]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::JournalLogic.png[align="center"]

*API* :
link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/volant/commons/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `JournalInputParser` class of the current feature to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `JournalLogicManager` of the current feature.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` of the current feature (e.g. adding a trip).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component of the Itinerary feature for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Class Diagram for the Model component on the `HOME` page
image::HomeClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

.Structure of the Model Component in Journal
image::JournalModelDiagram.png[align="center"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/location/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model` for `JOURNAL`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores an `Entry` 's data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Entry>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

.Structure of the Model Component in Itinerary
image::ItineraryModelDiagram.png[align="center"]

The `Model` for `ITINERARY`,
*API* : link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/volant/commons/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores an `Activity` 's data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Activity>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

*API* : link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/volant/commons/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the `LMNList` data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.volant.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

[[implementation-view-switching]]
=== View Switching for Navigation Commands
The entire process of view switching is executed in the `MainWindow.java` class.

[TIP]
====
*List of Navigation Commands*

* `goto` on the `HOME` page
* `goto` on the `TRIP` page
* `back`
* `home`
====

==== Implementation
Each `CommandResult` from an execution in the `MainWindow` class stores data on
*if a command is a navigation command or not, and which navigation command it is.* If the command is a navigation command, the `MainWindow` will execute the
appropriate functions to facilitate view switching.

In the view switching process, the `MainWindow` will do the following: +

. Switch the logic component of the program to the logic component of the next page
. Switch the model component of the program to the model component of the next page
. Switch the current storage of the program to the storage component of the next page
. Load the GUI components for the next page

For example, for the `back` command, the `MainWindow`:

.Activity diagram for view switching process in `MainWindow` for `back` command
image::back-activity-diagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
Pros: +

* As each page has its own components, the back end of the program is neater and better abstracted.
* Specialised logic components for each page allow for the same keywords to be used (e.g `add`, `delete`) on certain
pages.

Cons: +

* There are many steps to switching views
* If there are more pages, there will be many logic and model components to keep track of.

==== Special Cases
* When `back` command is used in the <<root-page>>, this would not have any effect on the current GUI being
displayed.
* When the `home` command is used in the <<root-page>>, this would not have any effect on the current GUI being
displayed as the user is already on the HOME page.


=== Specific Help Windows for different pages
==== Implementation
Each page in Volant has its own `{Page}HelpWindow` class.
<<implementation-view-switching, Upon switching views>>, the `MainWindow` will create a new `{Page}HelpWindow` containing
details of the commands that can be used on that page.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Syntax of the find command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):**
Help Window specifically details the commands that can be used on the page that the user is currently on.
** Pros: Very specific and allows added convenience for users when they want to use commands with many fields that they
cannot remember without having to refer to the User Guide.
** Cons: Every single page has to have its own class file for the Help Window, if there are many pages, there will be many files to keep track of.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a general Help Window that lists every single command for every page in Volant
** Pros: Only one Help Window class file needed and it is easy to implement.
** Cons: If all the commands are detailed on a single long Help Window, the user will have to inconveniently scroll through
the window to reach the section that details commands for the page that they are on.




=== Adding a trip in Home Page
==== Implementation
Adding a trip

The add trip feature allows user to add a trip to Volant. This feature is facilitated by `HomeInputParser`, `AddCommandParser`, and `AddCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the trip add mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the add command in `HOME` page and provides the required metadata in the correct format to be added.
2. `HomeInputParser` parses the input by the user to check if the input provided contains a valid command keyword.
3. `AddCommandParser` parses the remaining input by the user for metadata denoted with prefixes.
4. `AddCommandParser` checks if the metadata input by the user is in the desired format.
5. `AddCommandParser` creates a new `AddCommand` based on the metadata provided.
6. `HomeLogicManager` executes the `AddCommand`.
7. `HomeModelManager` checks if the new `TRIP` has any logical conflicts with existing `TRIP`(s)
8. `HomeModelManager` adds the module to the `UniqueTripList`.
9. A new folder with the `TRIP` name is created.
10. `HomeLogicManager` updates storage with updated `UniqueTripList`.
11. `MainWindow` receives `CommandResult` from `HomeLogicManager` containing success message to be displayed to user.
12. Trips displayed in `MainWindow` are updated and `MainWindow` displays success message.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a add trip command:

.Activity Diagram for `add` Command
image::AddTripActivityDiagram.png[align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How data is stored
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the trip details in main volant json folder and create a folder corresponding to `TRIP` name.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Less organised as all trip details are stored in one location. Any error in the way one trip is stored will cause all trips not to be loaded.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a individual json file for each trip details.
** Pros: An error in the file of one trip will not affect the loading of other trips.
** Cons: Harder to implement retrieval.

=== Sorting entries in Journal Page
==== Implementation
Sorting journal entries
The sort feature allows user to sort the entries in the `JOURNAL` of a trip. This feature is facilitated by `JournalInputParser`, `SortCommandParser`, and `SortCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the journal sort mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the sort command in `JOURNAL` page and provides a field which they want the entries to be sorted by.
2. `JournalInputParser` parses the input by the user to check if the input provided contains a valid command keyword.
3. `SortCommandParser` parses the remaining input by the user for field.
4. `SortCommandParser` checks if the field input by the user is a valid field to sort by.
5. `SortCommandParser` creates a new `SortCommand` based on the field provided.
6. `JournalLogicManager` executes the `SortCommand`.
7. `JournalModelManager` sorts the entries according to the input field.
8. `JournalLogicManager` updates storage with updated `UniqueEntryList`.
9. `MainWindow` receives `CommandResult` from `HomeLogicManager` containing success message to be displayed to user.
10. Jounral entries displayed in `MainWindow` are updated and `MainWindow` displays success message.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a sort journal command:

.Activity Diagram for `sort` Command
image::sortActivityDiagram.png[align="center"]]

=== Adding activities in Itinerary Page
==== Implementation
Adding an activity

The add activity feature allows user to add an activity to a current trip. This feature is faciliated by `ItineraryInputParser`, `AddCommandParser`, and `AddCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the activity add mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the add command in `ITINERARY` page and provides the required metadata in the correct format to be added.
2. `ItineraryInputParser` parses the input by the user to check if the input provided contains a valid command keyword.
3. `AddCommandParser` parses the remaining input by the user for metadata denoted with prefixes.
4. `AddCommandParser` checks if the metadata input by the user is in the desired format.
5. `AddCommandParser` creates a new `AddCommand` based on the metadata provided.
6. `ItineraryLogicManager` executes the `AddCommand`.
7. `ItineraryModelManager` checks if the new `ACTIVITY` has any logical conflicts with existing `ACTIVITY`(s)
8. `ItineraryModelManager` adds the activity to the `UniqueActivityList`.
9. The `itinerary.json` file in the current trip folder in storage is updated
10. `ItineraryLogicManager` updates storage with updated `UniqueActivityList`.
11. `MainWindow` receives `CommandResult` from `ItineraryLogicManager` containing success message to be displayed to user.
12. Activities displayed in `MainWindow` are updated and `MainWindow` displays success message.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a add activity command:

.Activity Diagram for `add` Command
image::AddActivity.png[align="center"]]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Prerequisite of the command
Since each trip is associated with one itinerary, when the user wants to use the add activity command, a trip must have already been created. This is why the order of the scence switching is important as it disallows user to create an activity that is not associated with any trip.


=== Finding activities in Itinerary Page
==== Implementation
Finding an activity

The find activity feature allows user to find one or several activities in the current trip with matching keywords provided. This feature is faciliated by `ItineraryInputParser`, `FindCommandParser`, and `FindCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the activity find mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the find command in `ITINERARY` page and provides one or several field(s) which they want to be displayed with the current keyword.
2. `ItineraryInputParser` parses the input by the user to check if the input provided contains a valid command keyword.
3. `FindCommandParser` parses the remaining input by the user for fields to be found.
4. `FindCommandParser` checks if the field input by the user is a valid field to find.
5. `FindCommandParser` creates a new `FindCommand` based on the fields provided.
6. `ItineraryLogicManager` executes the `FindCommand`.
7. A new find predicate is created to check for matching keyword from the current list of activities.
8. `ItineraryModelManager` checks the current `UniqueActivityList` to find activities with matching keywords provided based on the predicate created.
9. `ItineraryModelManager` updates the activities that matched in the `FilteredActivityList`.
10. `MainWindow` receives `CommandResult` from `ItineraryLogicManager` containing success message to be displayed to user.
11. Jounral entries displayed in `MainWindow` are updated and `MainWindow` displays success message.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a find activity command:

.Activity Diagram for `find` Command
image::FindItinerary.png[align="center"]]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Syntax of the find command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users are allowed to find according to specific fields. This is done by adding the prefixes(t/ for `title`, l/ for `location`, d/ for `date`, and t/ for `time`) before the keyword to be found
** Pros: Allows users to be very specific in the find command. This means that users can find activities with the keywords in the specific field that they want. This implementation also allows users to append one find command with multiple fields to narrow down the search in less steps.
** Cons: Cannot find the same keyword for multiple fields. The current implementation can also cause the CLI by the users to be longer as there is a need to specify the fields to find. Furthermore, this implementation is more troublesome to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** Users can find with one or a few keywords without the need to specify the fields.
** Pros: The commands would be a lot shorter and easy to use. This allows for cross-field search which is not possible with the current implementation. This implementation is also easier to implement.
** Cons: This makes it difficult to narrow down the search if the users want to be specific about which field the keyword is in. The current implementation allows for greater freedom in choosing the fields to search for, something this implementation would not be able to accomplish. Furthermore, as `date` and `time` have different format from `location` and `title`, the specified field would make it easier for users to search for activities with the same `date` or `time`.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a sort journal command:

.Activity Diagram for `sort` Command
image::SortActivityDiagram.png[align="center"]

=== Deleting Trip in Home Page

==== Implementation

The delete trip feature allows user to delete a trip in Volant. This feature is faciliated by `HomeInputParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, and `DeleteCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the delete command in `HOME` page and provides the desired index for deletion.
2. `HomeInputParser` parses the input by the user to check if the input provided contains a valid command keyword.
3. `DeleteCommandParser` parses the remaining input by the user for the index.
4. `DeleteCommandParser` checks if the index provided is valid; at most the number of trips in the list.
5. `DeleteCommandParser` creates a new `DeleteCommand` with the index provided.
6. `HomeLogicManager` executes the `DeleteCommand`.
7. `The trip folder in the file path along with its contents are deleted during execution.
8. `HomeModelManager` updates the `UniqueTripList`.
9. `HomeLogicManager` updates storage with updated `UniqueTripList`.
10. `MainWindow` receives `CommandResult` from `HomeLogicManager` containing success message to be displayed to user.
11. Trips displayed in `MainWindow` are updated and `MainWindow` displays success message.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes an add activity command:

.Activity Diagram for `delete` Command
image::deleteTripActivityDiagram.png[align="center"]]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to delete the trip
Since each trip is a folder containing the data of the trip's itinerary and journal. If the trip is deleted, the corresponding itinerary and journal json files should also be deleted. This prevents unnecessary files from being stored in the program.

=== Adding an activity in Itinerary Page

==== Implementation

The add activity feature allows user to add an activity to a current trip. This feature is faciliated by `ItineraryInputParser`, `AddCommandParser`, and `AddCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the activity add mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the add command in `ITINERARY` page and provides the required metadata in the correct format to be added.
2. `ItineraryInputParser` parses the input by the user to check if the input provided contains a valid command keyword.
3. `AddCommandParser` parses the remaining input by the user for metadata denoted with prefixes.
4. `AddCommandParser` checks if the metadata input by the user is in the desired format.
5. `AddCommandParser` creates a new `AddCommand` based on the metadata provided.
6. `ItineraryLogicManager` executes the `AddCommand`.
7. `ItineraryModelManager` checks if the new `ACTIVITY` has any logical conflicts with existing `ACTIVITY`(s)
8. `ItineraryModelManager` adds the activity to the `UniqueActivityList`.
9. The `itinerary.json` file in the current trip folder in storage is updated
10. `ItineraryLogicManager` updates storage with updated `UniqueActivityList`.
11. `MainWindow` receives `CommandResult` from `ItineraryLogicManager` containing success message to be displayed to user.
12. Activities displayed in `MainWindow` are updated and `MainWindow` displays success message.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes an add activity command:

=== Finding activities in Itinerary Page
==== Implementation
The find activity feature allows user to find one or several activities in the current trip with matching keywords provided. This feature is faciliated by `ItineraryInputParser`, `FindCommandParser`, and `FindCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the activity find mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the find command in `ITINERARY` page and provides one or several field(s) which they want to be displayed with the current keyword.
2. `ItineraryInputParser` parses the input by the user to check if the input provided contains a valid command keyword.
3. `FindCommandParser` parses the remaining input by the user for fields to be found.
4. `FindCommandParser` checks if the field input by the user is a valid field to find.
5. `FindCommandParser` creates a new `FindCommand` based on the fields provided.
6. `ItineraryLogicManager` executes the `FindCommand`.
7. A new find predicate is created to check for matching keyword from the current list of activities.
8. `ItineraryModelManager` checks the current `UniqueActivityList` to find activities with matching keywords provided based on the predicate created.
9. `ItineraryModelManager` updates the activities that matched in the `FilteredActivityList`.
10. `MainWindow` receives `CommandResult` from `ItineraryLogicManager` containing success message to be displayed to user.
11. Journal entries displayed in `MainWindow` are updated and `MainWindow` displays success message.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a find activity command:

Furthermore, as `date` and `time` have different format from `location` and `title`, the specified field would make it easier for users to search for activities with the same `date` or `time`.

=== Refreshing trips in Home Page

==== Implementation
The refresh feature allows user to repopulate the current page with the same data in the storage. This feature is faciliated by `HomeInputParser`, `RefreshCommandParser`, and `RefreshCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the refresh mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the rf command in `HOME` page.
2. `HomeInputParser` parses the input by the user to check if the input provided contains a valid command keyword.
3. `FindCommandParser` creates a new `RefreshCommand`.
4. `HomeLogicManager` executes the `RefreshCommand`.
5. `MainWindow` receives `CommandResult` and success message from `HomeLogicManager`.
6. `MainWindow` checks the current page user is on and repopulates display with list from `HomeModelManager`.
7. `MainWindow` displays success message.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a find activity command:

.Activity Diagram for `rf` Command
image::rfActivityDiagram.png[align="center"]]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to get the list to repopulate the data with
After sorting or finding a list, the user needed a way to view the original data. The construction of each model includes a list that contains the relevant data in storage. Using that list, the view can be repopulated with the original data.

=== Data Storage
All data (trip details, journal entry details and itinerary details) is saved in the `main.data` directory.

==== Organisation

.Data Storage in Volant
image::user-guide/data-storage.png[align="center"]

The data files are organised in a way that trip details are stored in `volant.json`, while journal and itinerary details
are stored in a `journal.json` file and a `itinerary.json` file respectively. Both of these data files are organised
under a directory that represents the trip that the journal and itinerary are associated with.

The following explanation provides more details about these data files:

* Within the `main.data` directory, the `volant.json` file contains a list of JSON objects, each representing a trip,
with key-value pairs identifying the trip name, location and date range.Upon creation of a trip named "ABC", the
`volant.json` file is updated with a new JSON object representing the trip. The `main.data.ABC` directory is also
created.

* When an activity is added to the itinerary, a `itinerary.json` file is created in the `main.data.ABC` directory,
containing a list of JSON objects, each representing an activity, with key-value pairs identifying the activity title,
location, date and time.

* When an entry is added to the journal, a `journal.json` file is created in the `main.data.ABC` directory, containing
a list of JSON objects, each representing a journal entry, with key-value pairs identifying the entry content, date,
time, location, feeling and weather.

==== Design Considerations
Pros:

* Each data file can be kept small in size.
* This allows for faster retrieval of trip/journal/itinerary information from these data files.

Cons:

* There is no single data file that provides an overview of all of a user's data.

==== Data storage implementation: Adding a new trip/activity
Given below is an example usage scenario where a user adds a new trip:

1. The user executes the add command and provides the name, location and date range.
2. A new `Trip` object is created with the specified name, location and date range.
3. In `HomeModelManager`, the `Trip` object is added to the `TripList`.
4. A new folder is created in the `main.data` directory with the specified trip name.
5. `HomeLogicManager` accesses the `volant.json` file in the `main.data` directory.
6. Each `Trip` object in the `TripList` is converted into a `JsonAdaptedTrip` object.
7. A new `JsonSerializableTripList` object is created with the `JsonAdaptedTrip` objects.
8. The new `JsonSerializableTripList` object is saved to the `volant.json` data file.
9. The program log displays a success message.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user adds a new trip:

.Activity diagram for adding a new trip

The process is similar for the scenario where the user adds a new activity to the itinerary, and the `itinerary.json`
data file is updated. The following activity diagram summarises this process:

==== Data storage implementation: Editing a trip
Given below is an example usage scenario where a user edits a trip:

1. The user executes the edit command and provides the updated details.
2. `HomeLogicManager` checks if the name of the trip was updated. If it was, a new directory will be created with the
new trip name. Data files in the previous folder are moved into this new folder. Following that, the old folder is
deleted.
3. `HomeLogicManager` accesses the `volant.json` file in the `main.data` directory.
4. Each `Trip` object in the `TripList` is converted into a `JsonAdaptedTrip` object.
5. A new `JsonSerializableTripList` object is created with the `JsonAdaptedTrip` objects.
6. The new `JsonSerializableTripList` object is saved to the `volant.json` data file.
7. The program log displays a success message.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user edits a trip:

.Activity diagram for editing a trip
image::editTripStorageActivityDiagram.png[align="center"]

==== Data storage implementation: Deleting a journal entry/itinerary activity
Given below is an example usage scenario where a user deletes a journal entry:

1. The user executes the delete command.
2. In `JournalModelManager`, the identified `Entry` is removed from the `EntryList`.
3. `JournalLogicManager` accesses the `journal.json` file in the specific trip directory.
4. Each remaining `Entry` object in the `EntryList` is converted into a `JsonAdaptedEntry` object.
5. A new `JsonSerializableEntryList` object is created with the `JsonAdaptedEntry` objects.
6. The new `JsonSerializableEntryList` object is saved to the `journal.json` data file.
7. The program log displays a success message.

This process is the same for scenarios where the user deletes an itinerary activity. The following activity diagram
summarises what happens when a user deletes a journal entry or itinerary activity:

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
